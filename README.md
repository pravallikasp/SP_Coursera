Hi! This is Siva Pravallika Sripathi Panditharadhyula. I have done my week 1 assignment and submitted in a compressed zip file. Here, I am writing about the assignment descriptions and the files you have to go through for grading. Thanks for grading my assignment.

I have created sort_array() function, find_maximum() function, find_minimum() function, find_mean() function, find_median() function, print_array() function and print_statistics() function in the stats.h file.

These functions sort the array from largest to smallest element, computes the maximum value, computes the minimum value, computes the mean, computes the median, prints the given input array,and prints all the statistical data respectively.

The stats.c file contains the main() function, where the input is taken and print_array(), print_statistics() functions are called. 

When compiled, these print functions will be called from the stats.h file and will print the input array along with all the statistical data including the sorted array.

Please find the detailed descriptions of the functions in the stats.h file 

Thank you
